# Examples

This folder contains **complete working examples** for reference.

## Structure

- **examples/src/** - Complete working source code implementation
- **examples/reports/** - Example report templates with detailed placeholders

## What These Are For

These examples are here to help us:
- See how the source code should work
- Get ideas for how to structure our reports
- Understand the project structure better

## Note

We're doing our actual work in:
- `src/` - Empty skeleton classes we need to implement
- `reports/` - Empty report templates we need to fill in
