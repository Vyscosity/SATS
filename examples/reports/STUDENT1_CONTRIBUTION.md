## Overview

This report details my individual contributions to the Student Attendance Tracking System (SATS) project, focusing on core data structures and linked list implementations.

---

## Responsibilities

### Primary Responsibilities
- Implementation of core data structures (LinkedList)
- Design and development of fundamental data structure components
- Integration of linked lists into the student management system

### Lessons Covered
- **Lesson 3:** [Topic]
- **Lesson 4:** [Topic]

---

## Code Contributions

### Files Created/Modified

#### 1. `src/dataStructures/LinkedList.java`
**Purpose:** Generic linked list implementation for managing student records and attendance lists

**Key Features:**
- Generic type support for flexibility
- Add, remove, get operations
- Size tracking
- Iterator-like functionality

**Code Highlights:**
```java
// Key methods implemented:
- add(T data)
- add(int index, T data)
- get(int index)
- remove(T data)
- remove(int index)
- contains(T data)
- size()
- isEmpty()
```

**Usage in Project:**
- Used in `StudentService` for maintaining student lists
- Used in `AttendanceService` for tracking attendance records
- Provides sequential access to student data

**Challenges Faced:**
- [Describe any challenges encountered]
- [How they were resolved]

## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Structure Design
[Describe the design decisions made for the LinkedList implementation]

### Algorithm Choices
[Explain any algorithms used in the implementation]

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:**
  - Insertion: O(1) at end, O(n) at specific index
  - Deletion: O(n) in worst case
  - Search: O(n)
  - Access: O(n)

- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
